# Horiseon
## HTML and CSS Debugging project

## In this project I was tasked to clean up the HTML and CSS coding for the Horiseon landing page.  I eliminated unnecessary code and made the existing code more readable by adding proper indentation, comments, and semantic elements.  

## Some bugs were also adressed and fixed such as hyperlinks not working.
