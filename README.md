# Horiseon
## HTML and CSS Debugging project

## In this project I was tasked to clean up the HTML and CSS coding for the Horiseon landing page.  I eliminated unnecessary code and made the existing code more readable by adding proper indentation, comments, and semantic elements.  

## Some bugs were fixed such as hyperlinks not working.  I also updated the CSS code to make it so that the header stays at the top of the page while scrolling, since the hero is so large that the header disappears before you get to the content.
